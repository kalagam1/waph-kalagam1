## The lab's overview

This lab focused on setting up the development environment for WAPH. In Part I, I installed Ubuntu 22.04 in VirtualBox and configured the system with essential packages. In Part II, I cloned both the public course repository and my private GitHub repository, and completed git-related tasks.

## Part 1 -  Ubuntu Virtual Machine & Software Installation

Created a new VirtualBox VM using the Ubuntu 22.04 ISO and allocated 4 GB RAM and 2 CPUs. After the OS was installed, I set up the following:

- Installed system updates
- Installed Apache2, Git, and Sublime Text
- Installed Google Chrome manually via .deb package
- Installed Wireshark and configured non-root access
