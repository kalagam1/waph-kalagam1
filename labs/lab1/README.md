## Report

## The lab's overview

This lab focused on understanding how the web works, specifically the HTTP protocol, and creating basic web applications using CGI in C and PHP. The main outcomes included:

 - Capturing and analyzing HTTP traffic with Wireshark.
 - Sending HTTP requests using telnet.
 - Writing and deploying CGI programs in C.
 - Developing simple PHP applications that handle GET and POST requests.

## Part 1 - The Web and HTTP Protocol

### Task 1: Familiar with the Wireshark Tool and HTTP Protocol

To understand how the HTTP protocol operates, I used Wireshark to capture and inspect traffic between my browser and a web server. I filtered packets using the keyword http and observed both HTTP Request and Response messages. This allowed me to identify the structure of HTTP messages, including headers, status codes, and content.

#### Wireshark HTTP request for index.html

 - This shows the request sent by the browser to example.com, including headers like Host, User-Agent, and Accept.

#### Wireshark HTTP response for index.html

 - This contains the serverâ€™s response, with headers such as Content-Type, Content-Length, and the actual HTML content of the page.

#### HTTP Stream

 - This shows the full conversation between client and server.

### Task 2: Understanding HTTP using Telnet and Wireshark

I used the telnet command to send an HTTP GET request to a server manually. Wireshark was used to capture and inspect these messages.

#### Summary:

 - The telnet session displayed a manual HTTP request and the server's response.
 - Compared to browser-generated requests, telnet requests were minimal and lacked headers like User-Agent.
 - The response message lacked formatting compared to browser responses.

#### Terminal showing HTTP request and response

 - This shows that the GET request and the HTTP request 200 OK response with the HTML content from the server. 

#### HTTP request message in Wireshark

Comparison with browser-based request:

 - The telnet request is simpler and lacks headers like:

  - User-Agent
  - Accept
  - Accept-Encoding
  - Connection

It only includes GET / HTTP/1.1 and Host.

#### HTTP response message in Wireshark

Comparison with Task 1 response:

 - The content is the same, but some headers like Content-Encoding, ETag,  may vary depending on how the request was formed telnet vs browser.

## Part 2 - Basic Web Application Programming

### Task 1: CGI Web Applications in C

### a. Hello World Program

#### Summary:

I wrote a simple C program to demonstrate a CGI web application. The code prints a basic HTTP header and a "Hello World" message. I compiled it using gcc and placed the executable in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/, which is the default CGI directory in Apache.

#### Hello World CGI in C

### b. HTML Template with CGI

#### Summary:

Next, I wrote another C CGI program that outputs valid HTML. I used a simple template from W3Schools, modified with my course and personal information.

#### Hello World CGI in C

### Task 2: A Simple PHP Web Application with User Input

### a. Hello World in PHP

Created a helloworld.php file that shows my name and PHP info using phpinfo().

#### Hello World in PHP

### b. Echo Web Application

Developed echo.php that captures user input using GET and POST methods. This application echoes the submitted data.

#### Hello World in echo.php

### Task 3: Understanding HTTP GET and POST Requests

### a. Wireshark GET Analysis

Used Wireshark to capture and analyze the GET request/response for echo.php.

### b. curl POST Request

Used curl -d "name=Mahitha" http://localhost/echo.php to send a POST request.

### c. Comparison
